# tflite-recommendation

Ð¢his project was created as a result of a project assignment on the subject "Intelligent mobile applications".

The main focus is presenting a certain set of books from which the user will be able to choose the ones he likes, and then the software should make a book recommendation based on the selection.

Model trained with: https://grouplens.org/datasets/book-crossing/
Thanks to:
Cai-Nicolas Ziegler, Sean M. McNee, Joseph A. Konstan, Georg Lausen; for providing the data set.

An Android mobile application has been developed that recommends books using a machine learning module.
As a newbie in the field of machine learning, I found TensorFlow very useful when integrating a model into an Android application.
